# Getting Started 

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: clone the project
bash
# using npm
git clone "project link"

## Step 2: install dependencies
bash
# using npm
npm install

## Step 3: Run Android and Ios builds 
bash
# using npm
npm run android 
npm run ios 

## Step 4: Start the Metro Server (Make sure your emulator is running)
bash
# using npm
npm start

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App
